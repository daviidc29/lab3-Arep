    "The CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen because it is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. It contains 60,000 small (32x32 pixels) color images divided into 10 mutually exclusive classes, such as airplanes, cars, cats, and dogs. This makes it ideal for training and testing machine learning models, especially for beginners, as it is relatively small and easy to work with. Additionally, the dataset is well-documented and comes with pre-defined training and test splits, simplifying the experimentation process.\n",
